# F746G_Timer_ETR
STM32F746G Disco Timer ETR Counter.
This project uses the external pin connected to the external input of TIMER8 (ETR2) as the source to increment the timer counter. Just connect a push button on STM32F746G Disco PI3 pin located on ARD D7 (Arduino extension connector) and a serial terminal (putty) to see the results. The counter overflows at 10.
